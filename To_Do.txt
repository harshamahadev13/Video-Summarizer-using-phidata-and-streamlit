ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TO SPEND TIME


AGENDA:
SIMPLE OUTPUT IS OKAY. BUT NOT ENOUGH FOR YOUR EXP.
BUILDING AROUND IT AND INTEGRATING IS THE KEY FOR A PRESENTABLE PROJECT


TASKS:
nice & proper usecase - may be image or videos - for resume purposes
-- Of course RAG
-- hopefully structured output
-- Possibly store in DB
-- Possibly vector database
-- Have to Check - fine tuning
-- presentable output - bot or streamlit kinda thing (add images into readme)
-- Finally - If possible - host it in a where others can see it instead of Local.
